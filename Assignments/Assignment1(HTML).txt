		Logical tags provide meaning to the content they enclose, and do not have any physical formatting associated with them.
		They are used to define the purpose or meaning of the content, rather than how it should look.
		Examples of logical tags include the <strong> tag, which indicates that the text within it should be rendered as strong or bold, and the <em> tag, which indicates that the text should be rendered as emphasized or italicized.
	Physical Tags :
		Physical tags, on the other hand, are used to specify how the content should be rendered or displayed.
		They have specific physical formatting associated with them, such as font size, color, and alignment.
		Examples of physical tags include the <font> tag, which allows you to specify the font and color of the text, and the <div> tag, which defines a division or section in the document.
