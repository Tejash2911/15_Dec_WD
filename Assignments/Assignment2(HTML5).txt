2.How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
Ans->	To embed audio and video in a web page in HTML, we can use the <audio> and <video> tags.
	The <audio> tag is used to embed audio files on a web page.
	It is written as <audio src="url">, where src is an attribute that specifies the URL of the audio file.
	For example,
		<audio src="song.mp3" controls>
  			Your browser does not support the audio element.
		</audio>
	In this example, the src attribute specifies the URL of the audio file (song.mp3) and the controls attribute adds playback controls to the audio player. 
	The <video> tag is used to embed video files on a web page.
	It is written as <video src="url">, where src is an attribute that specifies the URL of the video file.
	For example,
		<video src="video.mp4" controls>
  			Your browser does not support the video element.
		</video>
	In this example, the src attribute specifies the URL of the video file (video.mp4) and the controls attribute adds playback controls to the video player.
	We can also use the <source> tag to specify multiple sources for audio and video files.
	For example, we can use the <source> tag to provide different formats of the same audio or video file to ensure that the file is played on as many devices as possible.
	For example,
		<audio controls>
  			<source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  			<source src="song.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
		</audio>
	That's how we can embed audio and video in a webpage.




3.Semantic element in HTML5?
Ans->	HTML5 introduces a number of new elements that are designed to improve the semantics (meaning) of web content.
	These elements are called semantic elements, and they provide a more meaningful and structured way to represent content on the web.
	Some of the new semantic elements introduced in HTML5 include:
	-> <article>:
		The <article> element represents a standalone piece of content, such as a blog post, a news article, or a forum post.
	-> <aside>:
		The <aside> element represents content that is tangentially related to the content surrounding it, such as a sidebar or a note.
	-> <details>:
		The <details> element represents a summary or explanation that can be expanded or collapsed by the user.
	-> <header>:
		 The <header> element represents the header of a section or page.
	-> <nav>:
		The <nav> element represents a section of the page that contains navigation links.
	-> <footer>:
		The <footer> element represents the footer of a section or page.
	-> <section>:
		The <section> element represents a standalone section of content, such as a chapter, a widget, or a tab.
	-> <mark>:
		The <mark> element is used to highlight text for reference purposes, such as to mark a search term in the text.
	-> <figure>:
		The <figure> element represents a piece of self-contained content, such as an image or a diagram, along with a caption.
	-> <figcaption>:
		The <figcaption> element represents a caption for a <figure> element.




4.Canvas and SVG tags
Ans->	Both the <canvas> and <svg> tags are useful for drawing graphics on a web page.
	The <canvas> tag is an HTML5 element that is used to draw graphics on a web page.
	It is written as <canvas width="w" height="h"></canvas>, where width and height are attributes that specify the width and height of the canvas in pixels.
	The canvas is a blank area on the page, and you can draw on it using JavaScript.
	Here's an example of how to use the <canvas> tag to draw a rectangle on a web page:
	<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
	<script>
  		var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  		var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  		context.fillStyle = "red";
  		context.fillRect(10, 10, 50, 50);
	</script>
	In this example, the <canvas> tag is used to create a canvas element with a width of 200 pixels and a height of 100 pixels.
	The <script> tag is used to draw a red rectangle on the canvas using JavaScript.
	
	The <svg> tag is an HTML element that is used to draw graphics on a web page using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
	SVG is a vector graphics format that is based on XML, and it allows you to create scalable graphics that can be resized without losing quality.
	Here's an example of how to use the <svg> tag to draw a rectangle on a web page:
	<svg width="200" height="100">
  		<rect x="10" y="10" width="50" height="50" fill="red"></rect>
	</svg>
	In this example, the <svg> tag is used to create a canvas element with a width of 200 pixels and a height of 100 pixels.
	The <rect> tag is used to draw a red rectangle on the canvas.
