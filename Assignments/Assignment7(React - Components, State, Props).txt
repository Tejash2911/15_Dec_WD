1.What is React Js?
Ans->	-> React.js is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs) in web applications.
	-> It was developed by Facebook and is widely used by developers to create interactive and dynamic UI components.
	-> React.js follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into reusable and self-contained components.
	-> Each component represents a part of the user interface and manages its own state and rendering logic.
	-> Components can be nested and composed together to build complex UI structures.
	-> One of the key features of React.js is its virtual DOM (Document Object Model).
	-> React.js uses a virtual representation of the DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
	-> When changes occur in the UI, React.js compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM, and only updates the necessary parts, resulting in better performance and efficiency.
	-> React.js promotes the concept of "unidirectional data flow," where data flows in a single direction from parent components to child components. 
	-> This helps in maintaining a predictable state management and makes it easier to debug and understand the application.
	-> React.js can be used with other libraries or frameworks to build a complete web application.




2.What is NPM in React Js?
Ans->	-> NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript that comes bundled with Node.js.
	-> It is commonly used in React.js projects (and other JavaScript projects) to manage dependencies and package distribution.
	-> When developing a React.js application, we often need to use various libraries, frameworks, and tools to enhance functionality, handle state management, or simplify development tasks.
	-> NPM provides a vast ecosystem of pre-built packages that we can easily install and integrate into our project. 
	Here's how NPM works with React.js:
	-> Initializing a project
	-> Installing packages
	-> Managing dependencies
	-> Using installed packages
	-> Running scripts




3.What is Role of Node Js in react Js?
Ans->	-> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
	-> While React.js is primarily a front-end library for building user interfaces, Node.js plays a significant role in the React.js ecosystem.
	Here are some key roles of Node.js in React.js development:
	-> Development server:-
		 Node.js can be used to set up a development server for React.js applications.
	-> Build tools and bundlers:-
		Node.js is often used in conjunction with build tools and bundlers like Webpack or Parcel to optimize and bundle React.js applications for production.
	-> Package management:-
		Node.js comes with NPM, the package manager for JavaScript.
		NPM is commonly used in React.js projects to manage dependencies and install packages required for development and production.
	-> Server-side rendering (SSR):-
		Node.js enables server-side rendering in React.js applications. 
	-> Backend APIs and services:-
		While React.js is primarily a front-end library, you may still need to interact with backend APIs and services.
		Node.js can be used to build the backend of your application.




4.What is CLI command In React Js?
Ans->	-> In React.js, CLI (Command Line Interface) commands refer to the commands you can execute in the terminal to perform various tasks related to React.js development.
	-> CLI commands are typically provided by development tools and frameworks to streamline the development process.
	-> Here are some common CLI commands used in React.js:
		1.Creating The React App
		2.Start Development Server
		3.Build for Production
		4.Test the Application
		5.Additional Tools and Frameworks




5.What is Components in React Js?
Ans->	-> In React.js, components are the building blocks of user interfaces.
	-> They are self-contained, reusable pieces of code that encapsulate a specific set of functionality and UI elements. 
	-> Components allow you to break down your user interface into smaller, manageable parts, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain your React.js applications.
	-> React.js follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is composed of multiple components.
	-> Each component can have its own state, properties (props), and rendering logic.
	-> Components can be nested and composed together to create complex UI structures.
	There are two types of components in React.js:
	1.Functional Components: 
	-> Also known as stateless components or functional stateless components (FSC), these are defined as JavaScript functions.
	-> They accept a set of properties (props) as input and return a React element, describing what should be rendered.
	-> Functional components are simpler and easier to write and test,
	   and they are typically used for simple presentational components that don't have internal state or lifecycle methods.
	
	2.Class Components: 
	-> Class components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component base class.
	-> They have more features and flexibility compared to functional components.
	-> Class components can have internal state, lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate), and event handlers.
	-> They are suitable for more complex components that require internal state management or lifecycle methods.

	-> Both functional and class components can be used interchangeably in React.js applications.
	-> However, with the introduction of React Hooks, functional components have become more powerful.
	-> Components in React.js promote reusability, maintainability, and modular development. 
	-> They enable you to separate concerns, enhance code organization, and make it easier to reason about and test your application. 




6.What is Header and Content Components in React Js?
Ans->	In React.js, Header and Content components are two examples of components that can be used to structure and organize the user interface of a web application.
	These components are typically used in a layout or page structure to define the header section and the main content section of the application.
	1.Header Component:
	-> The Header component represents the top section of a web page or application. 
	-> It typically contains the branding/logo, navigation menus, and other elements that are consistent across multiple pages.
	->  The Header component can be responsible for rendering the site title, a navigation bar, user authentication status,
	    and any other relevant information or actions that should be displayed at the top of the application.

	2.Content Component:
	-> The Content component represents the main section of a web page or application, where the specific content or functionality is displayed.
	-> It can contain different components, such as forms, lists, cards, or any other elements that make up the core content of the page.
	-> The Content component is responsible for rendering the dynamic content or views based on the application's state or user interactions.

	These components can be used together within a parent component or layout to create a complete page structure.
	For example, a parent component called 'App' could use both the Header and Content components to structure the overall layout of the application.




7.How to install React Js on Windows, Linux Operating System? 
Ans->	To install React.js on Windows or Linux operating systems, you need to follow these general steps:
	-> Install Node.js and NPM:
		React.js requires Node.js and NPM to be installed on your system.
		Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that includes NPM, the package manager for JavaScript.
		You can download the installer for your operating system from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).
	-> Create a new React.js project:
		Once Node.js and NPM are installed, you can create a new React.js project using the Create React App tool,
		which sets up a basic React.js project structure and configuration files.
	-> Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Create React App globally:
		npm install -g create-react-app
	-> Navigate to the directory where you want to create your React.js project and run the following command to create a new project
		npx create-react-app my-app
	-> Replace "my-app" with the desired name for your project.
	-> Install dependencies:After the project is created, navigate into the project directory:
		cd my-app
	-> You can then use NPM or Yarn to install the project dependencies:
		npm install
		yarn install
	-> Start the development server by run the following command:
		npm start
	-> This will start the development server and open your application in a web browser.




8.How to Install NPM and How to check version of NPM?
Ans->	To install NPM (Node Package Manager) on your Windows or Linux operating system, you need to install Node.js.
	NPM is bundled with Node.js, so by installing Node.js, you automatically get NPM installed on your system.
	Here are the general steps to install Node.js and NPM:
	-> Visit the official Node.js website: Go to the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org.
	-> Download the installer: On the Node.js website, you'll see two versions available for download: LTS (Long-Term Support) and Current.
	-> It is recommended to download the LTS version for most use cases, as it provides stable features and security updates.	
	-> Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows or Linux) and click on the download button.
	-> Run the installer: Once the installer is downloaded, run the installer executable file.
	-> The installer will install both Node.js and NPM on your system.
	-> To check the version of Node.js:
		node -v
	-> To check the version of NPM:
		npm -v




9.How to check version of React Js?
Ans->	To check the version of React.js in your project, you can follow these steps:
	-> Open a terminal or command prompt.
	-> Navigate to the root directory of your React.js project.
	-> Locate the package.json file in your project directory. This file contains metadata and dependencies for your project.
	-> Open the package.json file using a text editor.
	-> Look for the "react" key under the "dependencies" or "devDependencies" section. 
	-> The value associated with the "react" key represents the version of React.js used in your project.
	-> Here's an example of what the "dependencies" section of a package.json file may look like:
		"dependencies": {
  			"react": "^17.0.2",
  			"react-dom": "^17.0.2"
		},
	-> In this example, the version of React.js being used is "17.0.2".
	-> Alternatively, you can run the following command in the terminal or command prompt within the root directory of your React.js project
		npm list react
	-> This command will show the version of React.js installed in your project.




10.How to change in components of React Js?
Ans->	To make changes in React.js components, you typically need to follow these steps:
	-> Locate the component:
		Identify the component file that you want to modify. 
		In a React.js project, components are usually stored in separate files, either as functional components or class components.
	-> Open the component file:
		Use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to open the component file you want to modify.
		Common file extensions for React.js components are .js or .jsx.
	-> Make the desired changes:
		Within the component file, you can modify the JSX (JavaScript XML) code to change the structure, content, or behavior of the component.
		JSX is a syntax extension used in React.js that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
	-> For example, if you want to change the text content of a component, you can locate the relevant JSX code that represents the text and modify it accordingly.
	-> Save the changes:
		 Once you've made the desired changes to the component, save the file to ensure the modifications are preserved.
	-> Observe the changes:
		If you have the React development server running (npm start or yarn start), 
		the changes will be automatically reflected in your application as you save the component file.
		You can then view the updated component in your browser.
	-> If you don't have the development server running, you'll need to start it using the appropriate command (npm start or yarn start) in the terminal or command prompt.
	-> This will recompile and reload your React.js application, applying the changes you made in the component.




11.How to Create a List View in React Js?
Ans->	To create a list view in React.js, you can follow these steps:
	-> Set up your project:
		Create a new React.js project or navigate to an existing project where you want to create the list view.
		Ensure that you have Node.js and NPM installed on your system.
	-> Create a new component:
		Create a new component file for your list view. You can name it something like ListView.js. 
		In this component, you'll define the structure and rendering logic for your list view.
	-> Define the data:
		Determine the data you want to display in the list view.
		It could be an array of objects, fetched from an API, or stored locally in the component's state.
	-> Implement the component:
		Inside the ListView component, define the JSX code that represents the list view structure.
		You can use a mapping function to iterate over the data array and generate the list items dynamically.
	-> Use the component:
		To use the ListView component in your application, import it into another component where you want to display the list view.
		For example, you might import it into your main App component.
	-> Style the list view:
		Optionally, you can apply CSS styles or use a styling library like styled-components, or Bootstrap to style the list view according to your desired design.
	
	By following these steps, you can create a basic list view in React.js.




12. Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks
Ans->	-> In React.js, lifecycle methods are used to manage the behavior and state changes of components at different stages of their lifecycle.
	-> Class components and functional components with hooks have different approaches to lifecycle management.
	->  Let's explore the lifecycle in both types of components:
		1.Lifecycle in Class Components:
		-> Class components in React.js have several lifecycle methods that can be overridden to perform specific tasks at different stages of the component's lifecycle.
		-> Here are some commonly used lifecycle methods:
			1.componentDidMount:
			-> This method is called immediately after the component is mounted (inserted into the DOM).
			-> It is commonly used to perform initial setup, such as fetching data from an API or setting up event listeners.
			2.componentDidUpdate:
			-> This method is called after the component has been updated (either due to changes in props or state).
			-> It is useful for performing side effects or additional operations based on the updated data.
			3.componentWillUnmount:
			-> This method is called just before the component is unmounted and removed from the DOM.
			-> It can be used to clean up any resources, such as canceling network requests or removing event listeners.
			4.render:
			-> This method is responsible for rendering the component's JSX code.
			-> It is called whenever the component needs to be re-rendered.
		-> Class components also have other lifecycle methods like shouldComponentUpdate, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, and componentDidCatch for more specific purposes.

		2.Lifecycle in Functional Components with Hooks:
		-> Functional components, introduced in React 16.8, can use hooks to manage state and perform lifecycle-like operations.
		-> Hooks allow functional components to have local state and lifecycle behavior.
		-> Here are some commonly used hooks:
			1.useState:
			-> This hook allows functional components to have local state.
			-> It returns a state variable and a function to update that variable. 
			-> It can be used to manage component-specific data and trigger re-renders.
			2.useEffect:
			-> This hook is similar to componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.
			-> It enables you to perform side effects, such as data fetching or subscriptions, after the component has rendered.
			-> The effect can also be cleaned up when the component is unmounted.
			3.useContext:
			-> This hook enables functional components to access the context values provided by the nearest Context.Provider higher up in the component tree.
			4.useReducer:
			-> This hook provides an alternative to useState for managing more complex state logic.
			-> It uses a reducer function to manage state transitions and returns the current state and a dispatch function to trigger state updates.
			5.useCallback and useMemo:
			-> These hooks optimize performance by memoizing functions and values, respectively.
			-> They help prevent unnecessary re-renders when dependencies haven't changed.
	
	-> Functional components with hooks allow for more concise code and improved readability.
	-> They offer flexibility in managing state and performing lifecycle-like operations.

	-> By understanding the lifecycle in both class components and functional components with hooks, 
	   you can effectively manage the behavior and state changes of your React.js components throughout their lifecycle.
