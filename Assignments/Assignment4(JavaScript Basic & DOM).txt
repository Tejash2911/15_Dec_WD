1.What is JavaScript?
Ans->	-> JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for creating interactive websites and web applications.
	-> It was first introduced in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
	-> JavaScript is often used to add interactivity to web pages, such as form validation, animations, and dynamic content updates.
	-> It is also commonly used for developing front-end web applications, as well as back-end server applications using Node.js.
	-> JavaScript code can be embedded directly in HTML pages or included as separate files, and it can be run on any modern web browser.



2.What is the use of isNaN function?
Ans->	-> The isNaN() function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a given value is an illegal number (NaN) or not.
	-> The function returns a boolean value of true if the given value is NaN, and false if the given value is a valid number or can be converted into a number.
	-> The isNaN() function converts its argument to a number before testing it for NaN. If the argument cannot be converted to a number, isNaN() returns true.
	-> The isNaN() function is a global function in JavaScript, which means that it can be called anywhere in your code without needing to be imported or defined first.
	-> It's important to note that isNaN() returns true for any value that is not a number, including non-numeric strings, undefined values, and objects.
	-> This can sometimes lead to unexpected results, so it's important to use the function carefully.
	-> If you need to check whether a value is a valid number, rather than whether it is NaN, you can use the Number.isNaN() function instead.
	   This function returns true only if the argument is NaN and false otherwise.
	ex:
		isNaN(123);		// returns false
		isNaN('hello'); 	// returns true
		isNaN('123'); 		// returns false
		isNaN('1e10000'); 	// returns true



3.What is negative Infinity?
Ans->	-> In JavaScript, negative Infinity is a special numeric value that represents the value of negative infinity,
	   which is a mathematical concept used to describe a number that is less than any other number.
	-> It is denoted by the symbol "-âˆž".
	-> In JavaScript, negative Infinity is represented by the keyword "Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY".
	-> It is a value that is smaller than any other number, including negative numbers,
	   and is typically the result of mathematical operations that involve division by zero or values that exceed the range of representable numbers.
	-> Here's an example of how negative Infinity can be used:
		console.log(1 / 0); 					// Infinity
		console.log(-1 / 0); 					// -Infinity
		console.log(1000000000 * Number.MAX_VALUE); 		// Infinity
		console.log(-1000000000 * Number.MAX_VALUE); 		// -Infinity
		console.log(Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY === -Infinity); 	// true



4.Which company developed JavaScript?
Ans->	-> JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation in the mid-1990s.
	-> Specifically, it was created by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape, in just 10 days in May 1995.
	-> Initially, it was called Mocha, then it was renamed to LiveScript before Netscape decided to use the name JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.
	-> JavaScript was released as part of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in 1995 and soon became a popular language for creating interactive web pages.
	-> Today, JavaScript is used by millions of developers around the world to create everything from simple web pages to complex web applications, 
	   and it has become an essential part of modern web development.



5.What are undeclared and undefined variables?
Ans->	In JavaScript, undeclared and undefined variables are two different concepts:
	1.Undeclared variables:
	   -> These are variables that have not been declared using the var, let, or const keywords.
	   -> When you try to use an undeclared variable, JavaScript will create a global variable with that name and assign it the value of "undefined".
	   -> This behavior can cause problems because it can lead to unintended changes to global variables and make your code harder to debug.
	   -> ex:
		function myFunction() {
  			x = 10; 			// undeclared variable
  			console.log(x);
		}
		myFunction(); 				// logs 10
		console.log(x); 			// logs 10
	
	2.Undefined variables:
	   -> These are variables that have been declared, but have not been assigned a value.
	   -> When you try to use an undefined variable, JavaScript will return the value of "undefined".
	   -> ex:
		let x;
		console.log(x); 			// logs undefined

	   -> It's important to note that undefined is also a data type in JavaScript, and it represents a value that is not assigned or not defined.
	   -> If you try to access a property or method on an undefined variable, you may get a runtime error.



6.Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
Ans->	Here's an example of how to add new elements to a web page dynamically using JavaScript:
	HTML:
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		<head>
  		   <title>Adding Elements Dynamically</title>
		</head>
		<body>
  		   <ul id="myList">
    		      <li>Item 1</li>
    		      <li>Item 2</li>
  		   </ul>
  		   <button onclick="addElement()">Add Element</button>
		</body>
		</html>

	JavaScript:
		function addElement() {
  		// create a new list item element
  		const li = document.createElement("li");

  		// create a new text node with the item number
  		const itemNumber = document.createTextNode("Item " + (document.getElementsByTagName("li").length + 1));

  		// append the text node to the list item
  		li.appendChild(itemNumber);

  		// add the new list item to the existing list
  		const myList = document.getElementById("myList");
  		myList.appendChild(li);
		}

	-> In this example, we have an unordered list (<ul>) with two list items (<li>), and a button that calls the addElement() function when clicked.
	-> The addElement() function creates a new list item element, 
	   creates a new text node with the item number, 
	   appends the text node to the list item,
	   and adds the new list item to the existing list.



7.What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
Ans->	ViewState and SessionState are two different concepts in ASP.NET web development:
	1.ViewState:
	   -> ViewState is used to store the state of a single web page in ASP.NET.
	   -> It's a hidden field that is sent to the client as part of the HTML and is then sent back to the server when the user submits the form.
	   -> ViewState is used to maintain the state of controls on the page, such as their values, selected options, and so on.
	   -> ViewState is stored on the client-side and is encrypted and hashed to prevent tampering.
	2.SessionState:
	   -> SessionState is used to store user-specific data across multiple pages in an ASP.NET web application.
	   -> SessionState is stored on the server-side and is identified by a unique session ID that is sent to the client in a cookie or as part of the URL.
	   -> SessionState can be used to store any kind of data that needs to be persisted across multiple requests, such as user preferences, shopping cart contents, and so on.

	-> Here are some of the key differences between ViewState and SessionState:
	   -> ViewState is used to maintain the state of controls on a single web page, while SessionState is used to maintain user-specific data across multiple pages.
	   -> ViewState is stored on the client-side, while SessionState is stored on the server-side.
	   -> ViewState is encrypted and hashed to prevent tampering, while SessionState is protected by a session ID that is sent to the client in a cookie or as part of the URL.
	   -> ViewState can increase the size of the HTML sent to the client, while SessionState can increase the load on the server if large amounts of data are stored.
	   -> ViewState is enabled by default in ASP.NET web pages, while SessionState needs to be explicitly enabled in the web.config file or in the page code.



8.What is === operator?
Ans->	-> The === operator is a strict equality operator in JavaScript.
	-> It compares two values for equality without performing type coercion.
	-> In JavaScript, the == operator is a loose equality operator that performs type coercion.
	-> For example, 1 == '1' would return true because the string '1' is coerced into the number 1.
	-> However, 1 === '1' would return false because the types are not equal.
	-> ex:
		console.log(1 === 1); 			// true
		console.log(1 === '1'); 		// false
		console.log(true === 1); 		// false
		console.log(null === undefined); 	// false
		console.log(NaN === NaN); 		// false
		console.log({} === {}); 		// false
		console.log([] === []); 		// false



9.How can the style/class of an element be changed?
Ans->	In JavaScript, the style or class of an HTML element can be changed using the style and classList properties of the element.
	1.Changing the style of an element:
		// Get the element by its ID
		const element = document.getElementById("my-element");

		// Change the background color
		element.style.backgroundColor = "red";

		// Change the font size and color
		element.style.fontSize = "24px";
		element.style.color = "white";

	2.Changing the class of an element:
		// Get the element by its ID
		const element = document.getElementById("my-element");

		// Add a class to the element
		element.classList.add("my-class");

		// Remove a class from the element
		element.classList.remove("old-class");

		// Toggle a class on the element
		element.classList.toggle("new-class");

	-> In the first example, we use the style property to change the background color, font size, and color of an element.
	-> We can access any CSS property of an element using the style property and set it to a new value.
	-> In the second example, we use the classList property to add, remove, or toggle a class on an element.
	-> This is useful for changing the styling of an element based on user interaction or other conditions.
	-> We can use the add() method to add a class to an element,
	   the remove() method to remove a class from an element,
	   and the toggle() method to add or remove a class depending on whether it's already present.



10.How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
Ans->	-> In JavaScript, you can read and write files using the File and FileReader objects, which are part of the File API.
	-> Here's an example of how to read a file:
		// Get the input element
		const input = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]');

		// Add an event listener to handle file selection
		input.addEventListener('change', function(event) {
  		// Get the selected file
  		const file = event.target.files[0];

  		// Create a FileReader object
  		const reader = new FileReader();

  		// Set up the onload event handler
  		reader.onload = function(event) {
    		// The file's contents are in event.target.result
    		console.log(event.target.result);
  		};

  		// Read the file as text
  		reader.readAsText(file);
		});

	-> In this example, we get a reference to an input element of type "file" and add an event listener to handle file selection.
	-> When the user selects a file, we create a FileReader object, set up an onload event handler to handle the file's contents,
	   and call the readAsText() method to read the file as text.
	-> To write a file, you typically need to use a server-side technology like Node.js, as JavaScript running in a web browser has limited access to the file system for security reasons.
	-> However, you can still generate files on the client-side using techniques like data URIs or the download attribute on anchor elements.
	-> Here's an example of how to generate a file on the client-side:
		// Create a data URI for a text file
		const dataURI = 'data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,Hello%20world!';

		// Create an anchor element
		const downloadLink = document.createElement('a');
		downloadLink.href = dataURI;

		// Set the filename and download attribute
		downloadLink.download = 'hello.txt';

		// Trigger a click event to download the file
		document.body.appendChild(downloadLink);
		downloadLink.click();
		document.body.removeChild(downloadLink);

	-> In this example, we create a data URI for a text file containing the string "Hello world!",
	   and use it to create an anchor element with the download attribute set to "hello.txt".
	-> When the user clicks the link, the browser will download the file with the specified filename.
	-> Note that this technique only works for small files, as data URIs can become quite long for large files.



11.What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
Ans->	In JavaScript, there are several types of looping structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times:
	1.for loop:
	   -> This loop executes a block of code a specified number of times.
	   -> Here's an example:
		for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  			console.log(i);			// code to repeat
		}
	2.while loop:
	   -> This loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
	   -> Here's an example:
		let i = 0;
		while (i < 10) {
  			console.log(i);			// code to repeat
  			i++;
		}
	3.do-while loop:
	   -> This loop executes a block of code at least once, and then continues as long as a specified condition is true.
	   -> Here's an example:
		let i = 0;
		do {
  			console.log(i);			// code to repeat
  			i++;
		} while (i < 10);
	4.forEach() method:
	   -> This method is used to loop over the elements of an array and execute a function for each element.
	   -> Here's an example:
		const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
		arr.forEach(function(element) {
  			console.log(element);		// code to repeat for each element
		});
	5.for...in loop:
	   -> This loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.
	   -> Here's an example:
		const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
		for (let prop in obj) {
  			console.log(prop + ': ' + obj[prop]);	// code to repeat for each property
		}
	6.for...of loop:
	   -> This loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object, such as an array or string.
	   -> Here's an example:
		const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
		for (const element of array) {
  			console.log(element);		// code to repeat for each element
		}


	-> Note that the for...in loop should only be used for objects, and not for arrays or other iterable data types.
	-> Each type of loop has its own use case and syntax,
	   and choosing the right loop for the job can make your code more efficient and easier to read.



12.How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
Ans->	-> In JavaScript, you can use the parseInt() function to convert a string of any base to an integer.
	-> The function takes two arguments:
		the first argument is the string to convert,
		and the second argument is the base of the string (which should be an integer between 2 and 36).
	-> Here's an example of how to use parseInt() to convert a binary string to an integer:
		const binaryString = "1010";
		const decimalNumber = parseInt(binaryString, 2);
		console.log(decimalNumber); // Output: 10
	-> In this example, we define a binary string "1010" and pass it to parseInt() with a base of 2.
	-> The function returns the decimal equivalent of the binary string, which is 10.
	
	-> Similarly, you can convert a string in any other base to an integer by passing the base as the second argument to parseInt().
	-> For example, to convert a hexadecimal string to an integer:
		const hexString = "FF";
		const decimalNumber = parseInt(hexString, 16);
		console.log(decimalNumber); // Output: 255
	-> In this example, we define a hexadecimal string "FF" and pass it to parseInt() with a base of 16.
	-> The function returns the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal string, which is 255.



13.What is the function of the delete operator?
Ans->	-> In JavaScript, the delete operator is used to delete an object's property or an element of an array.
	-> The syntax of the delete operator is as follows:
		delete object.property
		delete object[index]
	-> Here, object can be any JavaScript object,
	   and property and index are the name of the property or the index of the element to be deleted.
	-> When the delete operator is used to delete a property or an element, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the delete was successful or not.
	-> If the delete was successful, the return value is true. If the delete failed, the return value is false.
	-> Here's an example of using the delete operator to delete an object's property:
		const person = {
  			name: "John",
  			age: 30,
  			gender: "male"
		};

		delete person.age; 		// Delete the "age" property
		console.log(person); 		// Output: {name: "John", gender: "male"}
	
	-> Similarly, you can use the delete operator to delete an element from an array:
		const array = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

		delete array[1]; 		// Delete the second element ("banana")
		console.log(array); 		// Output: ["apple", undefined, "orange"]



14.What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
Ans->	In JavaScript, there are three types of popup boxes that can be used to display messages to the user:
	1.Alert box:
		-> This type of popup box is used to display an alert message to the user.
		-> It contains an OK button that the user can click to dismiss the alert.
		-> The syntax for displaying an alert box is as follows:
			alert("Message");
		-> Here, Message is the message to be displayed in the alert box.
	2.Confirm box:
		-> This type of popup box is used to display a message to the user and get their confirmation.
		-> It contains two buttons - OK and Cancel - that the user can click to either confirm or cancel the action.
		-> The syntax for displaying a confirm box is as follows:
			confirm("Message");
		-> Here, Message is the message to be displayed in the confirm box.
		-> The function returns a boolean value - true if the user clicks the OK button and false if the user clicks the Cancel button.
	3.Prompt box:
		-> This type of popup box is used to prompt the user to enter some input.
		-> It contains a text input field for the user to enter their input, as well as OK and Cancel buttons.
		-> The syntax for displaying a prompt box is as follows:
			prompt("Message", "Default Value");
		-> Here, Message is the message to be displayed in the prompt box, and Default Value is the default value for the input field.
		-> The function returns the value entered by the user, or null if the user clicks the Cancel button.



15.What is the use of Void (0)? 
Ans->	-> In JavaScript, void(0) is a special expression that is used to evaluate an expression and then return undefined.
	-> It is often used as the href value of an anchor tag to prevent the page from reloading when the user clicks on the link.
	-> Here's an example of using void(0) as the href value of an anchor tag:
		<a href="javascript:void(0)">Click me</a>
	-> In this example, when the user clicks on the "Click me" link, the JavaScript code void(0) is executed,
	   which evaluates the expression inside the parentheses and then returns undefined.
	-> Since undefined is not a valid URL, the browser does not reload the page.
	-> Using void(0) as the href value of an anchor tag is often used as an alternative to using # as the href value.
	-> The advantage of using void(0) is that it is more semantically correct and also prevents the page from scrolling to the top when the link is clicked.



16.How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
Ans->	In JavaScript, a page can be forced to load another page in a number of ways:
	1.Using window.location.href:
		-> This method sets the URL of the current window to the specified URL, causing the browser to navigate to that page.
		-> Here's an example:
			window.location.href = "http://www.example.com";
	2.Using window.location.replace:
		-> This method works similar to window.location.href, but instead of adding a new entry to the browser's history, it replaces the current entry.
		-> This means that the user cannot use the back button to navigate back to the previous page. 
		-> Here's an example:
			window.location.replace("http://www.example.com");
	3.Using window.open:
		-> This method opens a new browser window and loads the specified URL into it.
		-> Here's an example:
			window.open("http://www.example.com", "_blank");
		-> In this example, _blank is the name of the new window.
		-> If you want to open the URL in the same window, you can use _self as the window name.

	-> Note that forcing a page to load another page without the user's consent can be considered bad practice and can lead to a poor user experience.
	-> It's generally recommended to use links or buttons that the user can click to navigate to other pages instead of forcing a page to load a new page automatically.



17.What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
Ans->	-> The innerHTML property in JavaScript is used to dynamically add or change the content of an HTML element.
	-> While it can be a convenient way to manipulate the DOM, there are some potential disadvantages to using it:
	1.Security risks:
		-> Since innerHTML can be used to inject HTML and scripts into a page, it can be a security risk if user input is not properly sanitized.
		-> This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
	2.Performance issues:
		-> When you use innerHTML to add or change content, the entire HTML of the element is re-parsed and re-rendered,
		   which can be slow and inefficient, especially for large and complex pages.
	3.Accessibility problems: 
		-> When you use innerHTML to change the content of an element, you may inadvertently remove or change accessibility features such as ARIA attributes and keyboard focus.
	4.Separation of concerns:
		-> Using innerHTML can blur the separation between content and presentation, which can make it harder to maintain and update your code in the future.
	
	-> To avoid these potential issues, it's generally recommended to use other methods to manipulate the DOM,
	   such as creating and appending new elements, updating attributes and properties,
	   and using template literals and DOM manipulation functions such as createElement, appendChild, and setAttribute.
	-> These methods are generally safer, more efficient, and more maintainable than using innerHTML.
